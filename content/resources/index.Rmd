## At University of Oregon

:::uo

1. 5-course [Educational Data Science Specialization](https://education.uoregon.edu/data-science-specialization-educational-leadership) offered by UO College of Education, led by [Daniel Anderson](https://education.uoregon.edu/people/faculty/daniela). See course websites [here](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization) and [info sheet](EDS.jpg) below. Cannot recommend highly enough! `r emo::ji("star")` `r emo::ji("star")` `r emo::ji("star")` `r emo::ji("star")` `r emo::ji("star")`

4. [SlackRs workspace](https://uodatascience.slack.com/) -- use this to ask for help from other UO community members when you're stuck on something or need some advice. 

5. Each other! As grad students, one of the best resources you have access to is your peers. You can read more of my thoughts about this [here](https://bcullen.rbind.io/post/2020-03-08-data-science-training-needs-in-grad-school/). When in doubt, ask for help -- and pay it forward if/whenever you can. `r emo::ji("heart")`
