When you are given data to analyze, it will almost always be in a format that makes it hard to create visualizations, perform modelling, and generate tables. In other words, most of the time, it will need to be wrangled into the correct format. The dplyr package has a very powerful set of functions for doing just this. Today we will be covering the core dplyr "verbs" that allow you to transform your data with optimal specificity and efficiency.
