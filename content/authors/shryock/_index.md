Ian is a fourth-year doctoral student in the clinical and personality areas. His research focuses on understanding transdiagnostic emotional processes as they unfold in daily life. He is also interested in improving the measurement of psychological attributes in research and clinical practice. Accordingly, he uses a combination of mixed-effects models, distributional regression, and item response theory in his work.
