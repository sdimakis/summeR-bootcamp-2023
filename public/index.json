Thank you!\n \nMake sure you have a Zoom account set up through the University of Oregon. We will use the same Zoom link for each day of the bootcamp. You will receive the link through email and slack.\n Join the Slack workspace. This is how we will primarily be communicating with each other, and it is the best place to ask questions outside of the scheduled bootcamp hours. We’ll be using the channel #bootcamp2022. You should have received an email invitation to join the SlackRs workspace. If you haven’t received an invitation, send Cameron an email at ckay@uoregon.edu. When you join, please introduce yourself and say hello in the #bootcamp2022 channel!\n Download and install both R and RStudio. R is free and, for the purposes of the bootcamp, you will only need the free version of RStudio.
