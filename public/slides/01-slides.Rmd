# Basic computing

--

```{r}
# addition
2 + 3
```

--

```{r}
# subtraction
2 - 3
```

--

```{r}
# multiplication
2 * 3
```

--

```{r}
# division
10 / 2
```

---
# Basic computing

```{r}
# exponents
4^2
```

--

```{r}
# modulo
20 %% 10
```

--

```{r}
# roots
4^(1/2)
```

--

```{r}
# logs
log10(100)
```

---
# Basic computing

Thankfully, R follows the order of operations.

```{r}
2 + 2 * 3
```

--

```{r}
(2 + 2) * 3
```

--

***

All of the values computed thus far haven't been stored anywhere though...

---

# Storing values in objects

To keep a value in memory, we need to assign it to an **object**. 

--

To assign a value to an object, use the **assignment operator**. It looks like a left-pointing arrow: 

.center[
### `<-`
]

--
***

Let's use `<-` to assign the number 8 to an object called `x`.

```{r}
x <- 8 
```

--

Now we can call `x` by name, and it will print the value.

```{r}
x
```

---
# Style

Technically, both `<-` and `=` work as assignment operators. But we'll strictly use `<-` from here on out. 

--
***

This brings up a general coding principle of the day...

--


**Style is important!**

You want to use a consistent style so that others (including your future self) can easily and quickly read your code. 

--

We highly recommend following the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). We'll talk more about the tidyverse tomorrow.

--
***

Hint: You will type `<-` a LOT. The keyboard shortcut `Alt` + `-` or `Option` + `-` can be used to insert a `<-`.

---
# Storing values in objects

Now, let's take a look at the variable `y`...

--

```{r error=TRUE}
# print y
y 
```

--
***

Whoops! We didn't assign anything to `y`. Calling a variable that doesn't exist leads to an **error message**. 

--

You'll see a LOT of error messages when using R. Don't worry when this happens. This is 100% normal, and it happens to everyone all the time. 

--
***

```{r}
# assign 2 to y
y <- 2

# print y
y
```

---
# Storing values in objects

Now, we can use these variables in calculations.

--

***

Remember, `x <- 8` and `y <- 2`?

We can multiply them:

```{r}
x * y
```

--
***

But, remember, if we want to save the output of that calculation, we need to assign it to an object! 

```{r}
# assign the the product of x and y to z
z <- x * y

# print z
z
```

---
# Naming variables 

You may be wondering how to name variables in R. There are just a few rules...

--

1. Object names should start with a letter.

2. Object names can contain alphanumeric characters, underscores (`_`), and/or periods (`.`).

3. R is case sensitive, so `A` and `a` are different variables.

--
***

This is another element of *style*. 

Using a consistent style when naming variables makes your life easier. There are several to choose from.

I'll be using snake_case from here on out, but you can change to another option if you'd like.

# Your turn `r (yt_counter <- yt_counter + 1)`

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

Open the `01_r_basics.Rmd` file.

1. Create a variable called `var_1` that is equal to 4.

1. Then create a variable called `var_2` that is `var_1` raised to the power of 6. 

1. Print the results (i.e. check what value is assigned to `var_2`).

# Solution

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Q1]
```{r}
var_1 <- 4
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Q2]
```{r}
var_2 <- var_1^6
var_2
```

# R Markdown

.footnote[Artwork by [@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)]

R Markdown is a magical thing. It allows you to combine R code and plain text together in the same document. 

R Markdown documents end with the extension `.Rmd`. Let's take a look at how they work...

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmarkdown_wizards.png")
```
]

---
# R Markdown

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_annotated.png")
```

class: yourturn
# Your turn `r (yt_counter <- yt_counter + 1)`

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 2)
```

1. Go back to `01_r_basics.Rmd` and click `knit`. Take a look at the resulting file called `01_r_basics.html`. 

2. Insert `author: [YOUR NAME]` after `title: "Basics of R, RStudio, & R Markdown"` but before `output: html_document`. Re-knit the document.
