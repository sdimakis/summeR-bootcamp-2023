# Piping

# Pipe operator

One very useful function is the **pipe**:

### .center[`%>%`]

--

The pipe is part of the `{magrittr}` package, which is loaded as part of the `{tidyverse}` package (discussed in the next slide deck).

--

Pipes are a way to write code in a way that is easier to read and understand. They allow you to string a series of functions together into a pipeline.

--

Strictly speaking, a pipe passes an object on the **left-hand side** as the first argument of whatever function is on the **right-hand side**. 

--

In general form, this means that...

`x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`

---

# Pipe operator

Let's see an example...


```{r}
coffee_consumed <- c(20, 16, 16, 12, 0, 16, 30, 60)
```

Let's say we wanted to take the mean of the `coffee_consumed` vector  and then we wanted to round the resulting value.

--
***

We could do the following:

```{r}
coffee_consumed_avg <- mean(coffee_consumed)

round(coffee_consumed_avg)
```

--

This is inefficient.

background-position: 90% 5%
background-size: 10%

# Pipe operator


```{r}
coffee_consumed <- c(20, 16, 16, 12, 0, 16, 30, 60)
```

Let's say we wanted to take the mean of the `coffee_consumed` vector (as we did in the previous slide deck) and then we wanted to round the resulting value.

--

We could, instead, do the following:

```{r}
round(mean(coffee_consumed))
```
--
However, this is a bit hard to read.

---
background-image: url(images/hex/magrittr.png)
background-position: 90% 5%
background-size: 10%

# Pipe operator

```{r}
coffee_consumed <- c(20, 16, 16, 12, 0, 16, 30, 60)
```

Let's say we wanted to take the mean of the `coffee_consumed` vector (as we did in the previous slide deck) and then we wanted to round the resulting value.

***

In this case, we could use pipes to chain the functions together:

```{r}
coffee_consumed %>%
  mean() %>%
  round()
```

---
background-image: url(images/hex/magrittr.png)
background-position: 90% 5%
background-size: 10%

# Pipe operator

```{r}
coffee_consumed %>%
  mean() %>%
  round()
```

--
***

You can, essentially, think of the pipe as representing the phrase "and then..."

--

Verbally, we might describe the code we just wrote as "Start with the `coffee_consumed` data, **and then** calculate the mean, **and then** round the mean.

---
background-image: url(images/hex/magrittr.png)
background-position: 90% 5%
background-size: 10%

# Pipe operator

Note that you aren't limited to just two pipes. You can use many (MANY!) pipes to carry out some pretty complex operations.

--

For example:

```{r}
horror_movies_consumed <- c(JAN = 0, FEB =  1, MAR = NA, APR = 1, 
                            MAY = 3, JUN =  0, JUL =  2, AUG = 3, 
                            SEP = 1, OCT = 22, NOV =  1, DEC = NA)

horror_movies_consumed %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mean() %>%
  round() %>%
  cat("is the average number of horror movies consumed\nbetween January and December.")
```

class: yourturn
# Your Turn `r (yt_counter <- yt_counter + 1)`

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 30, color_border ="#FEE123")
```

The code below calculates the standard deviation of the US population between 1790 and 1970 and then rounds the resulting value.

```{r eval=FALSE}
round(sd(uspop, na.rm = TRUE))
```

1. Run the code chunk provided to calculate the rounded standard deviation of the US population between 1790 and 1970.

1. Re-write the code above using the pipe operator (`%>%`). Check that the answer you get matches the original code you ran above.
