# Your Turn 1

Q1. Use `pivot_longer()` to tidy `table4a` (included as part of the `tidyr` package).

```{r}
table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(cols      = ___,
               names_to  = ___, 
               values_to = ___)
```

Q2. Use `pivot_wider()` to tidy `table2` (included as part of the `tidyr` package).

```{r}
table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from  = ___,
              values_from = ___)
```
