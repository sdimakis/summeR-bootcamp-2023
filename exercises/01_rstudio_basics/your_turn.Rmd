# Your turn 1

1. Create a variable called `var_1` that is equal to 4.

```{r}
# Q1.

```


2. Then create a variable called `var_2` that is `var_1` raised to the power of 6. Print the results (i.e. check what value is assigned to `var_2`).

```{r}
# Q2.

```




# Your turn 2

1. Open the file `rmarkdown_example.Rmd` and click `knit`. Take a look at the resulting file called `rmarkdown_example.html`. 


2. Go back to `rmarkdown_example.Rmd`. Change the title to `"[Your name]'s example R Markdown Document"` and re-knit.
